# Buhler Line Machines Assignment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.4.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Important Notes:

  - You will notice that Attacher, Packer and the Running state icons are quite different, I used the ones in the project just to save up time, since I didn't find the other icons right away.
  - You will find the Machine model `machine.ts` and the machine state enum `line-machine-enum.ts` in the src folder (Normally I put those files in a component folder or a separate folder).
